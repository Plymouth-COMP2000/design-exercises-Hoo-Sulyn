## Note
**Third Party Resources**

A. Volley (Networking Library)
Role: Handles all asynchronous HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Engineering Benefit: Volley manages the networking thread pool automatically. This allowed me to implement Parallelism by offloading API calls to background threads, ensuring the UI remains responsive (ALO 1).

B. Google Material Design Components
Role: Provides standardized UI elements like MaterialButton, TextInputEditText, and NavigationView.
Engineering Benefit: Using these components ensures that the application follows HCI standards, providing a consistent and intuitive user interface across different device sizes (ALO 1).

C. AndroidX Libraries
Role: Core libraries for backward compatibility and modern Android architecture.
Engineering Benefit: Ensures the software is "efficient and usable" on older Android versions while utilizing modern lifecycle-aware components.
